        <div class="row">
            <p> Like life, artists die and when they do, their music tends to obtain more attention and streams due to
                the news of their death. Fans of artists and people who were not familiar tend to latch onto songs from
                that artist and play it in the coming weeks of the news, bringing up their popularity at the time around death.
                There have been numerous cases of artists getting more streams post-death announcement such as
                XXXTentacion, Pop Smoke, JuiceWrld, Prince and even Takeoff from the rap group Migos. Mac Miller is no
                different besides that his death marked a moment of sustained success and popularity after he was gone.

    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <p> After his death, his numbers never plateaued or took a nosedive, but rather a steady increase in monthly listeners. Miller increased his total Spotify monthly listeners by 1.76 million from Dec. 2018 to Dec. 2019.  </p>

    <h2> Circles and Mac's 2020 Success </h2>
    <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
            <p>  In Jan. 2020, Miller’s estate, along with producer Jon Brion, decided to release his only posthumous album, “Circles”. A week before "Circles” was released, Miller’s estate dropped the first and only single for the album in “Good News.” According to Chart Metric, “Good News” along with the “Circles’' release helped earn Miller nearly 11 million more monthly listeners in the span of one month. <br> The week he died in 2018, his monthly listenership increased to a little over 14 million listeners. After the Circles release, he continued this trajectory of success by not falling below 13 million listeners to present day. </p>

   <h2> Mac Miller's Estate and their Tactics </h2>
   <div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <p> Mac Miller’s estate promised to not release any new albums from Miller as they believe it would be a disservice to what he would want. While this is the case, they have found ways to keep Miller’s name in the spotlight with the approval of some feature verses, playlist placements and in the biggest way;  re-releasing some of his off-streaming mixtapes onto streaming services. </p>

  <h3> Mixtape Re-Releases</h3>

    <div class="row">
        <p> The mixtapes his estate released in the span of five years from his death include: “The High Life,” “Macadelic,” “I Love Life, Thank You,” “K.I.D.S” and “Faces.” These re-releases along with playlist placements have brought Miller’s monthly listeners to an all-time high, sitting at 24.5 million as of Dec. 2023. </p>

<h3> Miller's Life with the Spotlight </h3>
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <p> Miller was well known in the hip-hop community and even somewhat in popular culture, featuring on songs such as the 2013 Ariana Grande track, “My Way.” He later ended up dating Grande starting in Aug. 2016 to May. 2018, putting him in the spotlight; even that did not apply this increase in music popularity that his death did. </p>

<h2> The Bottom Line </h2>
<div class="container">
    <div class="row">
        <p> While people die and the music lasts forever, it often cannot take back the pain that family and fans of Miller felt when he passed away. The music can ease the pain and help mask it, but  his estate and fans should rest easy knowing that Miller’s numbers will continue to stay high and that more people will find and appreciate Mac Miller every day. Rest in Peace Mac Miller; <b> The Most Dope. </b> </p>
